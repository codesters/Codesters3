			<p class="main-part">A year ago, my life had collapsed around me. I'd worked myself
            into exhaustion, my father died suddenly, and my relationships
            with my work colleagues and loved ones were in turmoil. Little
            did I know at the time, out of my greatest despair was to come the
            greatest gift.
            I'd been given a glimpse of a Great Secretâ€”The Secret to life. The
            glimpse came in a hundred-year-old book, given to me by my
            daughter Hayley. I began tracing The Secret back through history.
            I couldn't believe all the people who knew this. They were the
            greatest people in history: Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, Hugo,
            Beethoven, Lincoln, Emerson, Edison, Einstein.
            Incredulous, I asked, "Why doesn't everyone know this?" A burn-
            ing desire to share The Secret with the world consumed me, and I
            began searching for people alive today who knew The Secret.
            One by one they began to emerge. I became a magnet: as I began
            to search, one great living master after another was drawn to me.</p>

			<p class="main-part">Codesters is a group initiated by a group of 3 Tech addicts with a view to use our programming skills for a better good. We build simple Websites to large Web-apps for clients and the ideas we ourself think are worth tinkering. Also we believe in open-source, so whatever we build is released in open-source licenses.(not client projects). Apart from building softwares, we organize Seminars and Hacker Meets in New Delhi(India) region, so anyone whether a student, a professional or even a tech-enthusiast can join.</p>
